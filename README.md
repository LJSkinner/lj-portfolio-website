# Luke Skinner's Portfolio Website

## What does this repo contain?
This repo contains the source code for my portfolio website which can be found [here](https://portfolio.ljskinner.com). This serves to highlight some of my current top projects as well as give an introduction to who I am, and what I do. It's not the best but gave me something to practise my web dev skills. Whenever I have things to add to this I will update this repo as well.

## Libraries & Credits
I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style this website and to learn their library for other projects I have in mind. So please go to their website and have a look. I also used a library called [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) (Animate on Scroll). This is a cool open source library that lets you do scrolling transitions by simply adding attributes to HTML elements. Please check out their website as well as their [Github](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)  and show them some support. For hosting, although it is not shown in this repo as I decided to keep the deployment separate I am using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for this simple portfolio website.

Finally, in this website I reference my good friend Andrew McGuckin quite a bit. So please go check out his [Github](https://github.com/AndrewMcGuckin) and also check out [Project Roundtable](https://github.com/Project-Roundtable) for projects which we collab on.
